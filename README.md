# VaidyaNext — EY Techathon 6.0

VaidyaNext is a decision intelligence prototype designed to support
early-stage pharmaceutical R&D evaluation through structured,
explainable analysis.

The system helps researchers and decision-makers assess whether a
proposed drug or compound should be **proceeded with, reviewed, or
rejected**, based on multiple scientific and business signals.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Pharmaceutical R&D teams often face challenges such as:
- Fragmented and contradictory scientific literature
- Lack of transparent evidence quality assessment
- Limited early visibility into novelty and patent risk
- Market demand evaluated late in the R&D lifecycle

These factors lead to long evaluation cycles and high early-stage risk.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview
VaidyaNext provides an explainable, rule-based evaluation framework that
converts multiple research signals into a single, defensible confidence
score.

Rather than acting as a predictive or autonomous AI system, the platform
focuses on **decision support, transparency, and governance readiness**.

---

## 🔍 6-D Evaluation Framework
The prototype follows a structured 6-D methodology:

- **Discover** – Identify relevant research signals (simulated)
- **Decode** – Extract key indicators and outcomes
- **Distill** – Evaluate evidence quality and consistency
- **Differentiate** – Assess novelty and patent risk
- **Demand** – Estimate unmet market need
- **Decide** – Generate a final confidence score and recommendation

---

## 🖥️ Working Prototype
The prototype is implemented as a web-based application that allows users to:
- Input disease/indication and compound details
- View dimension-wise evaluation scores
- Receive a final confidence score
- Obtain a clear **Proceed / Review / Reject** recommendation
- Understand the rationale behind the decision

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This project is a **prototype developed for EY Techathon 6.0**.
All data and scores are simulated and rule-based, intended solely to
demonstrate explainable decision logic.
The system does not replace clinical trials, regulatory review, or
expert medical judgment.
